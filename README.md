## MLJourney-FromBasicToIntermediate

- **MLJourney Overview:**
  - A daily commitment to understanding machine learning from the ground up.
  - Progress through fundamental algorithms.
  - Tackle real-world challenges to strengthen your skills.
  - Hands-on journey from basic to intermediate ML expertise.

- **Prerequisites** :
  - Familiarity with basic Python concepts.
  - Knowledge of plotting tools for data visualization.
  - Understanding of essential libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
  - Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.

- **Interview Preparation Component:**
  - For each algorithm covered, be prepared to enhance your practical understanding.
  - Includes a set of at least 5 interview questions tailored to that specific algorithm.
  - Aims to solidify theoretical knowledge and equip you with skills for real-world scenarios and interviews.

- **Notice:**
  - While some algorithms are versatile (suitable for both regression and classification tasks),
  - MLJourney focuses on exploring and implementing each algorithm in the context of either regression or classification.
  - This approach provides a deeper understanding of the specific nuances and applications associated with each type of problem.
  - Feel free to explore the dual nature of these algorithms on your own as you continue your machine learning journey.
